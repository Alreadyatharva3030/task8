Stored Procedures and Functions
This SQL project demonstrates the creation and usage of Stored Procedures and Functions to modularize SQL logic.
The procedure GetPassengerBookings retrieves all booking details for a given passenger, while the function CountBookingsForFlight calculates the total number of bookings for a specified flight.
It highlights concepts like IN parameters, conditional queries, and reusable database logic for cleaner and more efficient code.
